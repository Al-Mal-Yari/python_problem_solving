Enchant and Attack
In Fantasy Quest, a weapon can be enchanted to do bonus damage.

Assignment
Complete the enchant_and_attack function. It creates a new "enchanted" name for a weapon and calculates how much damage the enchanted weapon will deal to a targeted enemy.

It accepts 3 parameters:

target_health: integer
damage: integer
weapon: string
It should do the following things in the function body:

Calculate and store the "enchanted damage" in a new variable. The enchanted damage should be the input damage plus 10.
Calculate and store the "new health" in a new variable. The new health should be the input target_health minus the enchanted damage.
Create a new variable called enchanted_weapon. It should be the input weapon with the string "enchanted " added to the beginning of it. For example:
sword -> enchanted sword
axe -> enchanted axe
Return the enchanted weapon and the new health in that order.
